1. Preprocessing: implementing the #include <stdio.h> statement at the top of the C program
> Possible Error: Forgetting to include <stdio.h>

2. Compilation: compiling the code: gcc -c filename.c
> Possible Error: Errors within the code (like syntax errors) that prevent the code from compiling

3. Assembly: converting the code into a form the computer can understand: gcc filename.o -o executefilename
> Possible Error: Mistyping the command/messing up the order

4. Linking: Brings everything together into an executable program 
> Possible Error: Issues within the individual pieces preventing the collective from linking properly

5. Loading: Executing the program itself: ./filename
> Possible Error: Trying to execute a non-executable file
